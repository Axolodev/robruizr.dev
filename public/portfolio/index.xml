      <description>Introduction to the project About a year ago, Iknelia&amp;rsquo;s team became finalists in a competition organized by Tec de Monterrey, one of the top universities in Latin America and my place of work. In this contest, participants had to create a technological tool that would provide a means to improve the environmental situation.

      <description>About this project A project developed in association with the GeneralSoft backend team. This web application was built using NextJS as frontend and .net as backend.
I worked as the lead developer of a team of three people and coordinated the application&amp;rsquo;s frontend development. The greatest difficulty was to develop everything in a timeframe of six weeks. However, this period was met, and everything was delivered accordingly and deployed to a Windows server.</description>
