Hello, I'm Rob! I'm a Software Engineer who does Front-end web development. Currently, I'm doing a Master's degree in Human-Computer Interaction.

Oh, and I'm also a teacher! 

I love learning new stuff. I'm passionate about making technology easier for everyone to use, and more accessible. 

I do a lot of React. I've been doing it for six years. I've created e-commerce and marketing sites, enterprise platforms, company websites, and more. Would you like to check out my work? You can find more about it on the [Portfolio section](/portfolio), or get in touch with me using my [contact form](/contact) if you are interested in something in particular.

I speak both Spanish and English, and I'm currently learning German. 

In my free time, I play videogames, read fantasy novels, and practice martial arts. Sometimes I even sing!
