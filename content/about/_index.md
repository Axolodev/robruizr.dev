Hello, I'm Rob! I'm a Software Engineer who does Front-end web development. Oh, and I'm also a teacher. 

I do a lot of React. I've been doing it for over two years. I've created e-commerce and marketing sites, enterprise platforms, company websites, and more. Would you like to check out my work? DM me [@RobRuizR](https://twitter.com/RobRuizR) on Twitter or [Roberto Ruiz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robruizr/) on LinkedIn 

I love learning new stuff and making things easier for everyone to use. I'm currently learning about Interaction Design at the Interaction Design Foundation.

I speak both Spanish and English, and I'm currently learning German. 

In my free time, I play videogames, read fantasy novels, and practice Hapkido. Sometimes I even sing!
